            <p><stong>Sel Roti</stong>is a traditional, ring-shaped Nepali treat, often described as a cross between a doughnut and a bagel. It has a crispy, golden-brown exterior with a soft, slightly sweet, and fluffy inside. This deep-fried delicacy is especially popular during festivals like Tihar and Dashain. It is commonly enjoyed with yogurt, vegetable curry, or simply with a cup of tea.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Soaked Rice</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Ghee</li>
                <li>Baking Powder</li>
                <li>Mustard Oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Drain the soaked rice and grind it into a fine paste with minimal water. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
                <li>Add sugar, ghee, and cardamom powder (and baking powder if using). Mix into a thick, smooth batter, adding milk only if too stiff. It should ribbon off a spoon.li>
                <li>Heat oil in a wide pan over medium heat. Test with a drop of batter—it should sizzle and rise. Grease your hand (or a funnel), hold it over the oil, and pour the batter in a steady, continuous circle to form a ring.
                </li>
                <li>Fry 2-3 at a time, turning occasionally, until uniformly golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
            </ol>
